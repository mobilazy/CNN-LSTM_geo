4.1 Training Performance and Model Architecture

The CNN-LSTM model demonstrated rapid convergence during the 42-epoch training cycle with well-controlled learning dynamics throughout the process. Initial training loss started at 8.64 in epoch 1 and decreased steadily to 0.45 by epoch 42, showing consistent improvement in the model's ability to capture thermal response patterns. Validation loss began at 0.088 and stabilized around 0.028 by epoch 18, indicating that the model achieved effective generalization without overfitting to the training data. The model converged well within the allocated 50-epoch budget, indicating appropriate architecture design and learning rate selection for this geothermal forecasting application [4]. Early stopping activated after validation loss failed to improve for 16 consecutive epochs, preventing overfitting while maintaining the best-performing model state discovered during training. The small gap between training and validation loss of approximately 0.02 suggests the model learned generalizable patterns rather than memorizing training examples. Final validation loss of 0.027 represents effective thermal response prediction across all three BHE configurations.

Training on GPU hardware completed in approximately 45 minutes for the full 42 epochs, demonstrating practical feasibility for operational retraining schedules. Batch size of 1024 enabled efficient GPU utilization with memory consumption peaking at 2.1 GB. The optimized batch size maximized throughput while fitting comfortably in GPU memory. Mixed precision training using FP16 operations could reduce memory footprint further, though this optimization was unnecessary for the current model size given the low memory requirements. The training efficiency demonstrates practical feasibility for periodic model retraining in operational deployments. Monthly or seasonal retraining using recent operational data would maintain accuracy as thermal properties evolve over time.

The CNN-LSTM hybrid architecture balanced parameter efficiency with representational capacity through 75,489 trainable parameters distributed across multiple processing stages. Two convolutional layers with 32 and 64 channels respectively processed input sequences, learning local temporal patterns in 48-timestep input windows corresponding to 4 hours of operational data at 5-minute sampling intervals [5]. Kernel size of 3 provided focused receptive fields for capturing fine-grained dynamics in temperature, flow rate, and power measurements. The first convolutional layer activated on basic thermal transitions including temperature ramps during system startup, flow rate changes during operational mode switches, and power variations reflecting building load changes. The second convolutional layer combined basic features into complex temporal patterns, with activation maps showing sensitivity to multi-step sequences like morning startup periods characterized by rapid temperature increases or evening stabilization phases marked by gradual temperature decreases.

Two LSTM layers with 64 hidden units each processed convolutional features to capture long-range dependencies spanning multiple timesteps across the 48-step input window. The first LSTM layer encoded sequential information into hidden states, with cell states accumulating information about thermal trends and operating mode transitions. The second LSTM layer refined sequence encoding and prepared features for prediction, with hidden states at final timestep containing compressed information about entire 48-step history. Two fully connected layers transformed LSTM hidden states into outlet temperature predictions, reducing dimensionality from 64 to 32 units in the first layer before producing single-value temperature outputs. Dropout regularization at 10% rate appeared after each major processing stage, preventing overfitting during training while maintaining prediction accuracy during evaluation. Batch normalization in convolutional layers stabilized training dynamics and enabled higher learning rates [5].

4.2 Overall Prediction Accuracy and Dataset Characteristics

The trained model achieved strong predictive accuracy when evaluated on the 21-day test period. This holdout window contained 14,247 measurements across all three collector configurations. The complete dataset consisted of 190,732 total records, with 171,542 records used for training, 4,943 for validation, and 14,247 for testing. Overall test metrics showed Mean Absolute Error of 0.166°C and Root Mean Square Error of 0.227°C. The model architecture contained 75,489 trainable parameters distributed across convolutional and LSTM layers. These metrics indicate sub-degree accuracy suitable for operational forecasting applications. The RMSE remains small relative to typical temperature differentials of 3-5°C observed in the system during active heating mode [1].

The model used four primary input features for prediction. Supply temperature served as the primary thermal baseline, providing information about incoming fluid temperature entering the BHE system. Flow rate captured hydraulic conditions affecting heat transfer rates through the ground loop. Thermal power measurements reflected the heat extraction or rejection rate of the system. Configuration encoding differentiated between the three BHE types through numerical representation. This feature set enabled the model to learn relationships between operating conditions and thermal response across different collector geometries.

Single prediction inference completed in under 5 milliseconds on GPU hardware. Batch inference of 1024 predictions required 48 milliseconds, achieving 21,000 predictions per second. CPU inference remained practical with single predictions requiring 23 milliseconds on modern processors. The trained model occupied 289 KB on disk and required 1.2 MB in memory including framework overhead. These modest computational requirements enable deployment on resource-constrained building automation systems. Inference memory usage peaked at 8 MB for batch size of 1024.

4.3 Configuration-Specific Performance and Thermal Characteristics

Performance varied across the three BHE configurations. The model evaluated 4,390 test samples from the Single U45mm complete field installation, 4,999 samples from the Double U45mm research wells, and 4,810 samples from the MuoviEllipse research configuration. The Double U45mm configuration showed the best prediction accuracy with MAE of 0.158°C and RMSE of 0.218°C. This superior performance occurred despite having only 4 research wells compared to 120 in the complete field. The dual-pipe design provides enhanced thermal capacity through doubled surface area contact with borehole walls [3].

The complete dataset contained 59,316 measurements from Single U45mm wells, 66,379 measurements from Double U45mm wells, and 65,037 measurements from MuoviEllipse wells. Average thermal characteristics for Double U45mm showed supply temperature of 7.10°C, return temperature of 6.60°C, and temperature differential of -0.49°C. Flow rate per well averaged 2.83 m³/h. Power extraction per well reached -1.66 kW. The Double U45mm configuration achieved higher thermal power extraction per well while maintaining smaller temperature differentials. This combination indicates superior heat transfer efficiency [2], [3]. The doubled pipe cross-section accommodates higher flow rates with reduced pressure drop.

The Single U45mm complete field section exhibited intermediate prediction accuracy with MAE of 0.168°C and RMSE of 0.233°C. This configuration provides the baseline for comparison. The large number of parallel boreholes creates statistical averaging that dampens individual well variations. Average thermal characteristics during evaluation showed supply temperature of 7.57°C, return temperature of 6.99°C, and temperature differential of -0.57°C. Flow rate per well averaged 1.92 m³/h with power extraction of -1.34 kW per well. The negative temperature differential indicates heat extraction mode. The complete field operated predominantly in heating mode during the test period.

The MuoviEllipse 63mm configuration exhibited prediction accuracy between the other two designs with MAE of 0.174°C and RMSE of 0.230°C. The elliptical collector optimizes cross-sectional geometry for enhanced ground contact [8]. Average thermal characteristics showed supply temperature of 7.01°C, return temperature of 6.58°C, and the smallest temperature differential of -0.43°C among all three configurations. Flow rate per well averaged 2.95 m³/h. Power extraction reached -1.51 kW per well. The MuoviEllipse configuration achieved the smallest temperature differential among the three designs, indicating efficient heat transfer per unit flow.

Temperature differential between supply and return provides direct indication of heat transfer effectiveness [3]. The Single U45mm configuration showed 0.57°C differential with 1.34 kW per well, yielding normalized efficiency of 2.35 kW/°C. The Double U45mm configuration achieved 0.49°C differential with 1.66 kW per well, yielding 3.39 kW/°C efficiency. The MuoviEllipse configuration demonstrated efficiency of 3.51 kW/°C. Flow rates differed substantially across configurations due to differences in pipe geometry. The Single U45mm configuration operated at 1.92 m³/h per well. The Double U45mm configuration achieved 2.83 m³/h, representing 47% increase. The MuoviEllipse configuration reached 2.95 m³/h, showing 54% increase.

4.4 Temporal Dynamics During Evaluation Period

The 21-day forecast window captured characteristic temporal patterns in thermal response. All configurations exhibited clear daily temperature oscillations reflecting building heating demand patterns. Morning periods from 06:00 to 09:00 showed rapid temperature changes as circulation pumps activated. Supply temperatures increased as heat pumps ramped up to meet building loads. Daytime periods from 09:00 to 18:00 maintained relatively stable temperatures under steady heat extraction. Evening periods from 18:00 to 23:00 demonstrated gradual temperature stabilization as building loads decreased [7].

The forecast captured three complete weeks of operation with distinct weekend patterns differing from weekday operation. Weekday operation maintained consistent thermal extraction patterns with repeatable temperature profiles. Weekend periods exhibited reduced thermal extraction reflecting lower building occupancy. Week-to-week consistency validated model extrapolation capability. This stability indicates the model learned robust relationships. The evaluation period from October to November captured autumn to early winter transition. Supply temperatures decreased slowly across the forecast window as outdoor temperature decline drove increased building heating loads. Temperature differentials widened slightly over the forecast period as increased thermal extraction created larger supply-return temperature gaps.

Forecast accuracy remained consistent across the 21-day window. Early forecast periods from days 1 to 7 showed similar error distributions to late forecast periods from days 15 to 21. Prediction confidence varied with operating conditions. Stable weekday operation produced highly accurate forecasts. Weekend transitions and evening load changes introduced slightly larger prediction errors. The distribution showed slight positive skew with larger positive errors occurring more frequently than negative errors.

Error characteristics differed across collector types. Single U45mm predictions showed highest variance. The Double U45mm predictions exhibited lowest variance. The four-well research configuration provided cleaner measurement signals. The MuoviEllipse predictions showed intermediate variance. The model performed best within normal operating ranges where training data was most abundant.

4.5 Practical Deployment Considerations

Sub-degree prediction accuracy enables anomaly detection for predictive maintenance applications. Deviations exceeding 0.5°C sustained over multiple hours may indicate developing issues. Potential detectable problems include reduced ground thermal conductivity, flow distribution imbalances, heat exchanger fouling, and control system malfunctions [1], [7]. The 21-day forecast horizon supports medium-term operational planning. Building energy management systems can optimize heat pump operation schedules based on predicted thermal response [8].

Comparative performance across collector configurations provides evidence for design decisions. The analysis shows Double U45mm achieving best prediction accuracy and thermal efficiency in this installation. Site-specific factors including geology, drilling costs, and available space must be considered alongside thermal performance metrics [6]. Operational deployment requires continuous 5-minute measurements of supply temperature, return temperature, flow rate, and thermal power. Most modern geothermal installations already collect these parameters. Data quality significantly impacts prediction accuracy. Model retraining should occur periodically to adapt to changing ground conditions [1], [7].

The compact model size of 289 KB and low computational requirements enable deployment on standard building automation hardware. Monthly or seasonal retraining using recent operational data maintains accuracy as thermal properties evolve. The model demonstrated stable performance across the 21-day evaluation period without requiring intervention. This reliability supports autonomous operation in building management systems.
